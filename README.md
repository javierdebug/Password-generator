# Password Generator web app

Live site: https://javierdebug.github.io/Password-generator/

**About the project:** Created from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. This responsive web app is able to create random passwords
according to the user's inputs, such as the length of the password, what characters to include (numbers, letters, special). The
application relies on event handling and is able to arrange and manipulate DOM elements.
